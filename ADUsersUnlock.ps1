### Export User Accounts to CSV for Reference ###
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Finds locked Active Directory user accounts, exports their details to a CSV file,
and optionally unlocks them with confirmation.

.DESCRIPTION
This script searches Active Directory for user accounts that are currently locked out.
It retrieves specified properties for these accounts and exports the list to a CSV file.
It then prompts the user whether to attempt unlocking these accounts.
Error handling is included for file operations and unlocking accounts.

.PARAMETER ExportPath
The full path, including filename, where the CSV report of locked users will be saved.
Defaults to a timestamped file in C:\Temp.

.PARAMETER ForceUnlock
Switch parameter. If specified, the script will attempt to unlock accounts without asking for confirmation. Use with caution.

.EXAMPLE
.\FindAndUnlockUsers.ps1

Searches for locked users, exports them to C:\Temp\LockedOutUsers_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv,
and asks for confirmation before unlocking.

.EXAMPLE
.\FindAndUnlockUsers.ps1 -ExportPath "C:\ADReports\LockedUsers_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd').csv"

Searches for locked users, exports them to the specified path, and asks for confirmation
before unlocking.

.EXAMPLE
.\FindAndUnlockUsers.ps1 -ForceUnlock

Searches for locked users, exports them to the default path, and immediately attempts
to unlock them without confirmation.

.NOTES
Requires the Active Directory PowerShell module.
On Windows: Ensure RSAT for Active Directory Domain Services is installed.
On PowerShell 7+ (Windows): The module should work if RSAT is installed.
On PowerShell 7+ (Linux/macOS or Windows without RSAT): You need to use PowerShell Remoting
to connect to a machine with the Active Directory module installed (e.g., a Domain Controller
or management server) and run the script there or use Implicit Remoting.

Ensure the user running the script has permissions to:
- Search Active Directory
- Write to the specified ExportPath
- Unlock AD user accounts
