# --- How to use the function ---
# Save the code above as a .ps1 file (e.g., Set-Permissions.ps1)
# Dot-source it in your PowerShell session: . .\Set-Permissions.ps1
# Then call the function:
# Set-AdminOwnershipAndPermissions -Path "C:\Path\To\Your\foldername"
# Or use -WhatIf to see what would happen:
# Set-AdminOwnershipAndPermissions -Path "C:\Path\To\Your\foldername" -WhatIf
