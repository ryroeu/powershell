.SYNOPSIS
Identifies and attempts to stop services deemed "non-default" based on specific criteria.

.DESCRIPTION
This script retrieves Windows services, filters them based on DisplayName, PathName,
and Name properties to exclude common Windows and Microsoft services, and then
attempts to stop the remaining services. It waits for each service to confirm
it has stopped before proceeding, with a timeout.

WARNING: Stopping services can have unintended consequences. Ensure you understand
         which services are being targeted and the potential impact. Run with caution.
         Requires Administrator privileges.
