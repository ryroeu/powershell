<#
.SYNOPSIS
Flushes the DNS cache on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

.DESCRIPTION
This script automatically detects the operating system it is running on
and executes the appropriate command to flush the local DNS resolver cache.
It uses automatic variables ($IsWindows, $IsMacOS, $IsLinux) on PowerShell 6+
and legacy checks for Windows PowerShell 5.1.
On macOS and Linux, it uses 'sudo' and may prompt for an administrator password.
On Windows, it's recommended to run this script from an elevated (Administrator) PowerShell prompt.

.NOTES
Date:   2025-04-02
Requires: PowerShell (Windows PowerShell 5.1 supported for Windows OS only; PowerShell 6+ recommended for cross-platform compatibility).
          Administrator/root privileges may be required.
