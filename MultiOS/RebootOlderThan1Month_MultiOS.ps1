#Requires -RunAsAdministrator # On Windows, administrator privileges are needed for Restart-Computer/shutdown
# On Linux/macOS, this script needs to be run with sudo for the shutdown command.

.SYNOPSIS
Checks the system uptime and initiates a reboot if it exceeds one month.
Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

.DESCRIPTION
This script automatically detects the operating system it's running on.
It retrieves the timestamp of the last system boot.
It calculates the duration since the last boot (uptime).
If the uptime is greater than 30 days (approximating one month), it schedules
a system reboot to occur in 5 minutes.

Warning: This script forces a reboot. Ensure all work is saved on target machines.

Requires:
- Windows: PowerShell 5.1 or later. Run as Administrator.
- Linux: PowerShell Core (pwsh) 7+ installed. Run with sudo (sudo pwsh script.ps1).
- macOS: PowerShell Core (pwsh) 7+ installed. Run with sudo (sudo pwsh script.ps1).

.NOTES
Date:   2025-04-02
Version: 1.1

Definition of "one month": For simplicity and consistency, this script uses 30 days.

.EXAMPLE
# Run directly on any supported OS (ensure correct permissions/sudo)
./Check-UptimeAndReboot.ps1
